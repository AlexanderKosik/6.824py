# Thoughts, TODO, etc...

- Coordinator and worker talk via RPC
- The client application is a word count
	- Multiple other .so files are available
	- Can we use them in python?

- The worker will ask the coordinator for a task
	- Therefore we need no discovery of workers or anyting like that


# Worker
- Ask the coordinator for a task
- Read the task input (from one or more files)
- Execute the task
- Write the task output to a file

# Coordinator
The coordinator should notice if a worker has not completed its task in 10 seconds and give the same task to a different worker
